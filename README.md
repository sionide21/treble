Treble
======

Treble is a Chrome plugin that lets you bookmark webpages to a [Trello](https://trello.com/) board.


## Installation

To use Treble, you will need a copy of the [Trello client.js library](https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html#using-client-js). Simply download it and save it as `extension/scripts/trello.js`.

Once you have downloaded that file, follow [these directions](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#unpacked) and select the "extensions" folder of this project.
